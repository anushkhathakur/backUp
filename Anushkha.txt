1.	click on docker desktop 
2.	Open cmd as administrator
Launch command: "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe" –SwitchDaemon
3.	Create a Docker image file. The below command is used to create the image file.
docker build -t docker-service-registry.jar .

docker build -t anushkhathakur/fsd-repository:v1 .
docker push anushkhathakur/fsd-repository:v1
 .
4.	Go to the file location where your docker file is placed in spring boot application
5.	You can check the created image by using the "docker images" command.
6.	To push to a Docker registry, you need to have permission to push, which you do not have by default. 
Change the image prefix to your own Dockerhub ID and docker login to make sure you are authenticated before you run Docker.
7.You can push a new image to this repository using the CLI,Make sure to change tagname with your desired image repository tag.
docker tag local-image:tagname new-repo:tagname
docker push new-repo:tagname

docker tag docker-service-registry.jar:latest anushkhathakur/fsd-repository:latest
docker push anushkhathakur/fsd-repository:latest
8.Now, our image file is ready. We can push this image to Docker by using the below command. 
docker run -p 8761:8761 -t docker-service-registry.jar
9.Run docker build -t <your_username>/my-private-repo . to build your Docker image.
•  Run docker run <your_username>/my-private-repo to test your Docker image locally.
•  Run docker push <your_username>/my-private-repo to push your Docker image to Docker Hub. 

10. To remove image from local-image
docker images
docker rmi -f <image Id>

//To dockerize the angular
ng build
ng build --prod
1. open command prompt as administrator and traveres till your folder
"C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe" –SwitchDaemon
docker build -t pixogram-ui-image .
